space: sniffing, grazing, shaking_fur, urinating, standing_head_up, scratching_body, unknown, scratching_antlers, standing_head_down, scratching_hoof, laying, jumping, looking_at_camera, defecating, drinking, walking, running, bathing, vocalizing\n\nThe video is 2.00 second(s) long and you can see the frames below:\nFrame-1 at second 0.00: <image>\nFrame-2 at second 0.07: <image>\nFrame-3 at
