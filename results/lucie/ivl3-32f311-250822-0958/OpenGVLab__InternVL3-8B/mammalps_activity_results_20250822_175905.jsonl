Your task is to answer questions about the animals and their behaviors in a given video.\n\n**Instruction:**\nYou are provided with the following base function, which you can use to decompose the main question into subtasks and solve them step by step:\ndef recognize(entity_type: str, condition: Optional[str]) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"Returns all unique entities of the specified type detected in the video (e.g., 'animal', 'action', 'activity').\n    If condition is provided, returns all entities of the specified type that appear when the given condition is true.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> recognize(entity_type='animal')\n        ['dog', 'cat']\n        >>> recognize(entity_type='action')\n        ['bark', 'run']\n        >>> recognize(entity_type='action', condition='animal == dog')\n        ['bark', 'run']\n    \"\"\"\nIn addition to these base function, you may use standard Python functions such as average, max, min, sum, len, sorted, etc., as needed to help you answer the questions.\n\n**Output format:**\nYour final output should be 'Final answer:' followed by the list of activities recognized in the video, formatted as List[str].\n\nAn activity is a broader or longer-lasting pattern of behavior, often encompassing multiple actions that together form a functional behavioral state or mode.\nYou should use the following label space to identify activities:\nactivities label space: foraging, camera_reaction, resting, marking, vigilance, escaping, grooming, chasing, unknown, courtship, playing\n\n<video>\nProvide a list of all activities the animals are involved in during the video.\n\nYour answer should follow the example below:\nstep 1\nactivities = recognize(entity_type='activity')\noutput:List[str]: ['foraging']\n\nstep 2\nreturn activities\noutput:Final answer: ['foraging']"}
