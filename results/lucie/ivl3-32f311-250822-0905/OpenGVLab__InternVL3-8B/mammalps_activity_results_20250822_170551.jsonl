However, there is a consistent presence of a single animal throughout the frames.\n    - The animal appears to be stationary or moving very slightly, as there is no significant change of position or action observed in the frames.\n\n2. **Activity Recognition**:\n    - Given the lack of movement and the consistent presence of the animal, the most plausible activity is **resting**.\n    - There is no evidence of grooming, playing, or any other activities in the provided frames.\n\n3. **Using the recognize function**:\n    - We can use the `recognize` function to identify any specific activities. However, since the frames are too dark to provide clear visual data, we rely on the observed behavior.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\nactivities = recognize(entity_type='activity')\noutput:Final answer: ['resting']\n```\n\nFinal answer: Final answer: ['resting']"], "doc_hash": "74234e98afe7498fb5daf1f36ac2d78acc339464f950703b8c019892f982b90b", "prompt_hash": "6bd7295ceb7bd2b4f10600929a1d274cb18746e84a1c5c01713125bb3050f86e", "target_hash": "f67a9a66fd2225fd864f1454897e871a3d6c8d8353c53477ba03e88809d42ba0", "jaccard": 0.0, "input": "You are an assistant specialized in analyzing animal videos.
