Since the frames are mostly dark and not very clear, it's challenging to identify specific actions directly from the frames. However, we can assume that the actions are related to the animal's general behavior in a natural setting, such as grazing, walking, or standing.\n\n### Step 3\nGiven the lack of clear visual information from the frames, we will make an educated guess based on typical animal behaviors in a natural setting. We will assume that the animal is likely engaged in a common activity such as grazing or standing.\n\n### Step 2\nFinally, we will return the identified actions.\n\n```python\nFinal answer: ['grazing']\n```\n\nThis is a hypothetical answer based on the assumption that the animal is likely grazing or standing in a natural setting.
