Your task is to answer questions about the animals and their behaviors in a given video.\n\n**Instruction:**\nYou are provided with the following base function, which you can use to decompose the main question into subtasks and solve them step by step:\ndef recognize(entity_type: str, condition: Optional[str]) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"Returns all unique entities of the specified type detected in the video (e.g., 'animal', 'action', 'activity').\n    If condition is provided, returns all entities of the specified type that appear when the given condition is true.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> recognize(entity_type='animal')\n        ['dog', 'cat']\n        >>> recognize(entity_type='action')\n        ['bark', 'run']\n        >>> recognize(entity_type='action', condition='animal == dog')\n        ['bark', 'run']\n    \"\"\"\nIn addition to these base function, you may use standard Python functions such as average, max, min, sum, len, sorted, etc., as needed to help you answer the questions.\n\n**Output format:**\nYour final output should be 'Final answer:' followed by the list of actions recognized in the video, formatted as List[str].\n\nAn action is a discrete, often well-defined motor event or behavior performed by an animal, typically characterized by a specific goal or function.\nYou should use the following label space to identify actions:\nactions label space: sniffing, looking_at_camera, scratching_hoof, grazing, running, drinking, shaking_fur, jumping, unknown, bathing, urinating, scratching_body, standing_head_up, scratching_antlers, vocalizing, laying, standing_head_down, defecating, walking\n\n<video>\nWhat actions do the animals perform during the video?\n\nYour answer should follow the example below:\nstep 1\nactions = recognize(entity_type='action')\noutput:List[str]: ['eating', 'attending']\n\nstep 2\nreturn actions\noutput:Final answer: ['eating', 'attending']"}
